# CVPR
This repository is based on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR). Like the majority of other machine learning systems, computer vision needs a lot of data to adequately train its algorithms to comprehend that data. On the other hand, using different algorithms, a pattern can be found mathematically or physically.Â
